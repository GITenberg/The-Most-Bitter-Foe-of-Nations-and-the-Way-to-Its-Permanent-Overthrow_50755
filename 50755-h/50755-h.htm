<h2><a name="ADDRESS" id="ADDRESS">ADDRESS.</a></h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>In this sacred struggle and battle of so many hundred years,&mdash;this
weary struggle of truths to be recognized,&mdash;this desperate
battle of rights to be allowed;&mdash;in this long, broad current
toward more truth and more right, in which are seen the hands
of so many good and bad and indifferent men,&mdash;and in the
midst of all, and surrounding all, the hand of very God,&mdash;what
political institution has been most vigorous against this current,&mdash;what
political system has been most noxious to political
truth and right?&mdash;in short, what foe, in every land, have
right and liberty found it hardest to fight or outwit?</p>

<p>Is it Ecclesiasticism?&mdash;is it Despotism?&mdash;is it Aristocracy?&mdash;is
it Democracy?</p>

<p>The time allotted me this evening I shall devote to maintaining
the following Thesis:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Of all systems and institutions, the most vigorous in battling
Liberty,&mdash;the most noxious in adulterating Right,&mdash;the
most corrosive in eating out Nationality, has been an
Aristocracy based upon habits or traditions of oppression.</span></p>
</div>

<p>I shall also attempt to deduce from the proofs of this a corollary,
showing <em>the only way in which such an Aristocracy ever
has been or ever can be fought successfully and put down permanently</em>.</p>

<p>Let me first give this Thesis precision.</p>

<p>I do not say that Aristocracy, based upon habits and traditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of oppression, is the foe which takes deepest hold;&mdash;Despotism
and Ecclesiasticism are dragons which get their
claws far deeper into the body politic;&mdash;for Despotism clutches
more temporal, and Ecclesiasticism more eternal interests.</p>

<p>Nor do I say that Aristocracy is the enemy most difficult to
find and come at. Demoralization in Democracy is harder to
find and come at; for demoralization in Democracy is a disease,
and lurks,&mdash;Aristocracy is a foe, and stands forth&mdash;bold;
Demoralization is latent, and political doctors disagree about it,&mdash;Aristocracy
is patent, and men of average sense soon agree
about it.</p>

<p>But the statement is that Aristocracy, based upon oppression,
is, of all foes to liberty the most vigorous, of all foes to rights
the most noxious, and of all foes to nationality the most corrosive.</p>

<p>Other battles may be longer;&mdash;but the battle with Aristocracy
is the sharpest which a nation can be called upon to
wage,&mdash;and as a nation uses its strength during the contest&mdash;and
<em>as it uses its wits after the contest</em>&mdash;so shall you find its
whole national life a success or a failure.</p>

<p>For my proofs I shall not start with <em>a priori</em> reasoning:&mdash;that
shall come in as it is needed in the examination of historical
facts. You shall have the simple, accurate presentation
of facts from history&mdash;and plain reasoning upon these facts&mdash;and
from Ancient History, rich as it is in proofs, I will draw
nothing!&mdash;all shall be drawn from the history of modern States&mdash;the
history of men living under the influence of great religious
and political ideas which are active to-day&mdash;and among
ourselves.</p>

<p>Foremost among the examples of the normal working of an
Aristocracy based upon the subjection of a class, I name
<span class="smcap">Spain</span>. I name her first&mdash;not as the most striking example,
but as one of those in which the evil grew most naturally, and
went through its various noxious phases most regularly.</p>

<p>The fabric of Spanish nationality had much strength and
much beauty. The mixture of the Barbarian element with the
Roman, after the Roman downfall, was probably happier there
than in any other part of Europe. The Visigoths gave Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the best of all the barbaric codes. Guizot has shown how,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as
by inspiration, some of the most advanced ideas of modern enlightened
codes were incorporated into it.</p>

<p>The succeeding history of the Spanish nation was also, in its
main sweep, fortunate. There were ages of endurance which
toughened the growing nation,&mdash;battles for right which ennobled
it;&mdash;disasters which compacted manliness and squeezed
out effeminacy.</p>

<p>This character took shape in goodly institutions. The city
growth helped the growth of liberty, not less in Spain than in
her sister nations. Cities and towns became not merely centres
of prosperity, but guardians of freedom.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Then came, perhaps, the finest growth of free institutions in
Mediæval Europe.</p>

<p>The Cortes of Castile was a representative body nearly a
hundred years before Simon de Montfort laid the foundations
of English parliamentary representation at Leicester.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The
Commons of Arragon had gained yet greater privileges earlier.</p>

<p>Statesmen sat in these&mdash;statesmen who devised curbs for
monarchs, and forced monarchs to wear them. The dispensing
power was claimed at an early day by Spanish Kings as
by Kings of England;&mdash;but Hallam acknowledges<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that the
Spaniards made a better fight against this despotic claim than
did the English. The Spanish established the Constitutional
principle that the King cannot dispense with statutes centuries
before the English established it by the final overthrow of the
Stuarts.</p>

<p>Many sturdy maxims, generally accounted fruit of that early
English boldness for liberty, are of that earlier Spanish period.
"No taxation without representation" was a principle asserted
in Castile early, often and to good purpose. In Arragon no war
could be declared,&mdash;no peace made,&mdash;no money coined without
consent of the Cortes.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Great Privilege of Saragossa" gave quite as many, and
quite as important liberties to Arragon as were wrested from
King John for England in the same century.</p>

<p>Such is a meagre sketch of the development of society at
large. As regards the other development which goes to produce
civilization&mdash;the development of individual character, the
Spanish peninsula was not less distinguished. In its line of
monarchs were Ferdinand III., Alfonso X., James II., and
Isabella;&mdash;in its line of statesmen were Ximenes and Cisneros&mdash;worthy
predecessors of that most daring of all modern statesmen,
Alberoni. The nation rejoiced too in a noble line of
poets and men of letters.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Still more important than these brilliant exceptions was the
tone of the people at large. They were tough and manly.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>No doubt there were grave national faults. Pride&mdash;national
and individual&mdash;constantly endangered quiet. Blind submission
to Ecclesiastical authority was also a fearful source of
evil! Yet, despite these, it is impossible not to be convinced,
on a careful reading of Spanish history, that the influence
which tore apart States,&mdash;which undermined good institutions,&mdash;which
defeated justice,&mdash;which disheartened effort,&mdash;which
prevented resistance to encroachments of Ecclesiasticism and
Despotism&mdash;nay, which made such encroachments a <em>necessity</em>&mdash;came
from the <em>nobility</em>.</p>

<p>The Spanish nobility had risen and become strong in those
long wars against the intruding Moors,&mdash;they had gained additional
strength in the wars between provinces. They soon
manifested necessary characteristics. They kept Castile in confusion
by their dissensions,&mdash;they kept Arragon in confusion
by their anti-governmental unions.</p>

<p>Accustomed to lord it over inferiors, they could brook no
opposition,&mdash;hence all their influence was Anarchic; accustomed
to no profitable labor of any sort, their influence was for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
laziness and wastefulness;&mdash;accustomed to look on public matters
as their monopoly, they devoted themselves to conjuring
up phantoms of injuries and insults, and plotting to avenge
them.</p>

<p>Every Aristocracy passes through one, and most Aristocracies
through both of two historic phases.</p>

<p>The first may be called the <em>Vitriolic</em>,&mdash;the period of intense,
biting, corrosive activity,&mdash;the period in which it gnaws fiercely
into all institutions with which it comes into contact,&mdash;the
period in which it decomposes all elements of nationality.</p>

<p>In Spain this first period was early developed and long continued.
Grandees and nobles bit and cut their way into the
Legislative system,&mdash;by brute force, too, they crushed their
way through the Judicial system,&mdash;by judicious mixtures of
cheating and bullying they often controlled the Executive
system.</p>

<p>Chapter after chapter of Mariana's history begins with the
story of their turbulence, and ends with the story of its sad results;&mdash;how
the nobles seized King James of Arragon;&mdash;how
the Lara family usurped the Government of Castile;&mdash;how the
houses of Lara, Haro, Castro and their peers are constantly concocting
some plot, or doing some act to overthrow all governmental
stability.</p>

<p>But their warfare was not merely upon Government and
upon each other;&mdash;it was upon the people at large. Out from
their midst comes a constant voice of indignant petitions.
These are not merely petitions from serfs. No! history written
in stately style has given small place to their cries;&mdash;but the
great flood of petitions and remonstrances comes from the substantial
middle class, who saw this domineering upper class
trampling out every germ of commercial and manufacturing
prosperity.</p>

<p>Such was the current of Spanish history. I now single out
certain aristocratic characteristics bedded in it which made its
flow so turbulent.</p>

<p>Foremost of these was that first and most fatal characteristic
of all aristocracies based on oppression&mdash;<em>the erection of a substitute
for patriotism</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Devotion to caste, in such circumstances, always eats out
love of country. A nobility often fight for their country&mdash;often
die for it;&mdash;but in any supreme national emergency,&mdash;at
any moment of moments in national history the rule is that you
are sure to find them asking&mdash;not "What is my duty to my
country?" but "<em>What is my duty to my order?</em>"</p>

<p>Every crisis in Spanish history shows this characteristic,&mdash;take
one example to show the strength of it.</p>

<p>Charles the Fifth was the most terrible of all monarchic foes
to the old Spanish institutions. The nobles disliked him for
this. They also disliked him still more as a foreigner. Most
of all they disliked him because the tools he used in overturning
Spain were foreigners.</p>

<p>Against this detested policy the cities of the kingdom planned
a policy thoughtful and effectual. Cardinal Cisneros favored
it,&mdash;the only thing needed was the conjunction of the nobles.
They seemed favorable&mdash;but at the supreme moment they
wavered. The interest of the country was clear;&mdash;but <em>how as
to the interests of their order</em>? They began by fearing encroachments
of the people;&mdash;they ended by becoming traitors,
allowed the battle of Villalar to be lost&mdash;and with it the last
chance of curbing their most terrible enemy.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Another characteristic was <em>the development of a substitute
for political morality</em>.</p>

<p>These nobles were brave. The chronicles gave them plentiful
supply of chivalric maxims, and they carried these out into
chivalric practices. Their quickness in throwing about them
the robes of chivalry was only excelled by their quickness in
throwing off the garb of ordinary political morality. They
could die for an idea, yet we constantly see among them acts
of bad faith&mdash;petty and large&mdash;only befitting savages.</p>

<p>John Alonzo de la Cerda, by the will of the late King, had
been deprived of a certain office; he therefore betrays the
stronghold of Myorga to the new King's enemies.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Don Alonzo
de Lara had caused great distress by his turbulence. Queen
Berengaria writes an account of it to the King. Don Alonzo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
does not scruple to waylay the messenger, murder him, and
substitute for the true message a forgery, containing an order
in the Queen's hand for the King's murder.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Of such warp and
woof is the history of the Spanish aristocracy&mdash;the history of
nobles whose boast was their chivalry.</p>

<p>How is this to be accounted for? Mainly by the fact, I
think, that the pride engendered by lording it over a subject
class lifts men above ordinary morality. If commonplace
truth and vulgar good faith fetter that morbid will-power
which serf-owning gives, truth and good faith must be rent
asunder.</p>

<p>The next characteristic was <em>the erection of a theory of easy
treason and perpetual anarchy</em>.</p>

<p>Prescott calls this whimsical; he might more justly have
called it frightful.</p>

<p>For this theory, which they asserted, maintained, and finally
brought into the national notion and custom was, that in case
they were aggrieved&mdash;<em>themselves being judges</em>&mdash;they could renounce
their allegiance, join the bitterest foes of king and
nation,&mdash;plot and fight against their country,&mdash;deluge the land
in blood,&mdash;deplete the treasury; and yet that the King should
take care of the families they left behind, and in other ways
make treason pastime.</p>

<p>Spanish history is black with the consequences of this theory.
Mariana drops a casual expression in his history which shows
the natural result, when he says: "The Castro family were
<em>much in the habit</em> of revolting and going over to the Moors."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The absurdity of this theory was only equaled by its
iniquity.</p>

<p>For it involved three ideas absolutely fatal to any State&mdash;<em>the
right of peaceable secession&mdash;the right of judging in their own
cause, and the right of committing treason with impunity</em>.
Now, any nation which does not, when stung by such a theory,
throttle it, and stamp the life out of it, is doomed.</p>

<p>Spain did not grapple with it. She tampered with it, truckled
to it, compromised with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>This nursed another characteristic in her nobility, which is
sure to be developed always under like circumstances. This
characteristic was <em>an aristocratic inability to appreciate concessions</em>.</p>

<p>The ordinary sort of poor statesmanship which afflicts this
world generally meets the assumptions and treasons of a man-mastering
caste by concessions. The commercial and manufacturing
classes love peace and applaud concessions. But concessions
only make matters worse. Concessions to a caste, based
upon traditions of oppression, are but fuel to fire. The more
privileges are given, the higher blazes its pride, and pride is
one of the greatest causes of its noxious activity. Concessions
to such a caste are sure to be received as tributes to its superiority.
Such concessions are regarded by it not as favors but
as rights, and no man ever owed gratitude for a right.</p>

<p>There remained then but one way of dealing with it,&mdash;that
was by overwhelming force; and at the end of the Fifteenth
Century that force appeared. The encroachments upon regular
central government produced the same results in Spain as
in the rest of Europe at about the same time.</p>

<p>To one not acquainted with previous history, but looking
thoughtfully at the fifteenth century, it must seem strange that
just at that time&mdash;as by a simultaneous and spontaneous movement&mdash;almost
every nation in Europe consolidated power in
the hands of a monarch. In France, in England, in Italy, as
well as in Spain, you see institutions, liberties, franchises, boundaries
sacrificed freely to establish despotism. You see Henry
VII. in England, Louis XI. in France, Charles V., a little
later, in Germany and Italy, Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain&mdash;almost
all utterly unlovely and unloved&mdash;allowed to build up
despotisms in all cases severe, and in most cases cruel. Why?
Because the serf-owning caste had become utterly unbearable;
because one tyrant is better than a thousand.</p>

<p>Then the Spanish nobility went into the next phase. Ferdinand,
Charles the Fifth, Philip the Second&mdash;three of the
harshest tyrants known to history,&mdash;having crushed out the
boldness and enterprise of the aristocracy it passed from what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
I have called the <em>Vitriolic</em> into what might be called the <em>Narcotic
period</em>.</p>

<p>A period this was in which the noble became an agent in
stimulating all evil tendencies in the monarch, and in stupefying
all good tendencies in the people.</p>

<p>The caste spirit was a drug infused into the body politic,
rendering inert all its powers for good. Did Charles the Fifth
insult and depose Ximenes,&mdash;the nation sleepily permitted it;
did Philip the Second lay bigot plans which brought the kingdom
to ruin,&mdash;the nation lazily fawned upon him for it;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> did
Philip III. and his successors allow the nation to sink into
contempt,&mdash;there was no voice to raise it.</p>

<p>Do you say that this resulted from Ecclesiasticism? I answer
that the main reason why Ecclesiasticism became so
strong was because it sheltered the lower class from the exactions
of the Aristocracy. Do you say that it resulted from
Despotism? I answer that Despotism became absolute in order
to save the nation from the turbulence of the Aristocracy.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>No single Despotism, either in Church or State, could by
itself have broken that well-knit system of old Spanish liberties.
It was the growth of an oppressive caste, who by their
spirit of disunion made Despotism possible, and by their spirit
of turbulence made it necessary.</p>

<p>The next nation in which I would show the working of a
caste with traditions of oppression is <span class="smcap">Italy</span>.</p>

<p>Man-owners had cost Italy dear already. Roman serf-culture
had withered all prosperity in the country; slave service
had eaten out all manliness from the city.</p>

<p>It is one of the most pregnant facts in history, and one which,
so far as I know, has never been noted, that whereas the multitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
who have written upon the subject have assigned innumerable
causes for the decline and downfall of the Roman nation,
<em>not one of any note has failed to name, as a cause, Roman
slavery</em>. As to other causes they disagree&mdash;on this alone
all agree.</p>

<p>The philosophers Montesquieu<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and Gibbon,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the economist

to name as a cause of Roman ruin the system of forced labor.</p>

<p>But after the Roman downfall the straggle of Italy with her
upper caste seems singularly fortunate. At an early day her
cities by commerce became rich and strong. Then in the natural
course of things&mdash;first, free ideas, next, free institutions,
next, war upon the nobles to make them respect these ideas
and institutions.</p>

<p>The war of municipalities against nobles was successful.
Elsewhere in Europe cities sheltered themselves behind lords;
in Italy lords sheltered themselves in cities. Elsewhere the
lord dwelt in the castle <em>above</em> the city; in Italy the lord was
forced to dwell in his palace <em>within</em> the city.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The victory of freedom seemed complete. The Italian republics
were triumphant; the nobility were, to all appearance,
subdued.</p>

<p>But those republics made a fearful mistake. They had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
great chance to destroy caste and lost it. They allowed the
old caste spirit to remain, and that evil leaven soon renewed
its work. The republics showed generalship in war, but in
peace they were outwitted.</p>

<p>First, the nobles insisted on pretended rights within the city,
and stirred perpetual civil war to make these rights good.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Beaten at this they had yet a worse influence. Those great
free cities would not indeed allow the nobles to indulge in private
wars, but gradually the cities caught the infection from
the nobles. The cities caught their aristocratic spirit of jealousy,&mdash;took
nobles as leaders,&mdash;ran into their modes of plotting
and fighting, and what I have called the <em>Vitriolic</em> period set in.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly some of this propensity came from other causes,
but the main cause was this domineering aristocracy in its
midst, giving tone to its ideas. Free cities in other parts of
Europe disliked each other,&mdash;a few fought each other,&mdash;but
none with a tithe of the insane hate and rage shown by the
city republics of Italy.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Hence arose that political product sure to rise in every nation
where an aristocracy shape policy, the <em>Spirit of Disunion</em>.
Its curse has been upon Italy for five hundred years. Dante
felt it when he sketched the torments of Riniero of Corneto and
Riniero Pazzo,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and the woes brought on Florence by the feuds
of the Neri and Bianchi.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Sismondi felt it when his thoughts
of Italian disunion wrung from his liberty-loving heart a longing
for Despotism.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> All Italy felt it when Genoa, in these last
years, solemnly restored to Pisa the trophies gained in those
old civil wars, and hung them up in the Campo Santo behind
the bust of Cavour.</p>

<p>No other adequate reason for the chronic spirit of disunion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
in Italy than the oppressive aristocratic spirit can be given.
Italy was blest with every influence for unity;&mdash;a most favorable
position and conformation, boundaries sharply defined on
three sides by seas and on the remaining side by lofty mountains,
a great devotion to trade, a single great political tradition,
a single great religious tradition, both drawing the nation
toward one great central city.</p>

<p>Had Italy been left to herself without the disturbing influence
of this chivalric, uneasy, plotting, fighting caste, who can
doubt that petty rivalries would have been extinguished and
all elements fused into a great, strong Nationality?</p>

<p>Turn from this history and construct such a society with
your own reason. You shall find it all very simple. Put into
energetic free cities or states a body of men accustomed to lord
it over an inferior caste, whose main occupation is to brood
over wrongs and to hatch revenges, and you ensure disunion
between that state and sister states speedily. To such men
every movement of a sister state is cause for suspicion, every
betterment cause for quarrel.</p>

<p>But you ensure more than that. Under such circumstances
<em>disunion is always followed by disintegration</em>. They are
two inevitable stages of one disease. In the first stage the
idea of country is lost; in the second, the idea of government
is lost; disintegration is closely followed by Anarchy, and Despotism
has generally been the only remedy.</p>

<p>To Italy in this strait despotism was the remedy. Disunion
between <em>all</em> Italian Republics was followed by disintegration
between factions in <em>each</em> Italian Republic. A multitude of
city tyrants rose to remedy disintegration,&mdash;a single tyrant
rose above all to remedy disunion.</p>

<p>These were welcomed because they at least mitigated anarchy.
If a Visconti or a Sforza was bad at Milan, he was better
than a multitude of tyrants. If the Scala were severe at
Verona, they were less severe than the crowd of competitors
whom they put down. If Rienzi was harsh at Rome, he was
milder than the struggles of the Colonna and Orsini,&mdash;if the
Duke of Athens was at once contemptible and terrible at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Athens, he was neither so contemptible nor so terrible as the
feuds of the Cerchi and Donati.</p>

<p>And when, at last, Charles the Fifth crushed all these seething
polities into a compact despotism, that was better than
disunion, disintegration and anarchy.</p>

<p>This compression of anarchic elements ended the Vitriolic
period of Italian Aristocracy, but it brought on the Narcotic
period. It was the most fearful reign of cruelty, debauchery
and treachery between the orgies of Vitellius and De Sade.</p>

<p>Yet those debaucheries and murders among the Borgias and
later Medici, and so many other leading families, were but types
of what this second phase of an oppressive aristocracy <em>must</em> be.</p>

<p>For the domineering caste-spirit immediately on its repression
breaks out in cruelty. This is historical, and a moment's
thought will show you that it is logical. The development
of the chivalric noble into the cruel schemer is very easily
traced.</p>

<p>Given such a lordling forced to keep the peace, and you have
a character which, if it resigns itself, sinks into debauchery&mdash;which,
if it resists, flies into plotting. Now both the debauchee
and the plotter regard bodies and souls of inferiors as mere
counters in their games,&mdash;hence they <em>must</em> be cruel.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>I turn now to another nation where the serf-mastering spirit
wrought out its fearful work in yet a different manner, and on
a more gigantic scale,&mdash;in a manner so brilliant that it has dazzled
the world for centuries, and blazoned its faults as virtues;&mdash;on
a scale so great that it has sunk art, science, literature,
education, commerce and manufactures,&mdash;brought misery upon
its lower caste,&mdash;brought death upon its upper caste,&mdash;and has
utterly removed its nation from modern geography, and its
name from modern history. I point you to <span class="smcap">Poland</span>.</p>

<p>Look at Polish history as painted by its admirers,&mdash;it is noble
and beautiful. You see political scenes, military scenes,
and individual lives which at once win you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Go back three centuries, stand on those old towers of Warsaw,&mdash;look
forth over the Plains of Volo. The nation is gathered
there. Its King it elects. The King thus elected is limited
in power so that his main function is to do justice. The whole
voting body are <em>equals</em>. Each, too, is <em>free</em>. No King, no Noble,
is allowed to trench upon his freedom. So free is each that no
will of the majority is binding upon him, except by his own
consent. Here is equality indeed! Equality pushed so far that
each man is not only the equal of every other&mdash;but of all others
together;&mdash;the equal of the combined nation.</p>

<p>These men are brave, hardy, and, as you have seen, free,
equal, and allowed more rights than the citizens of any republic
before or since.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>But leave now this magnificent body&mdash;stretching over those
vast plains beyond eye-reach. Tear yourselves away from the
brave show&mdash;the flash of jeweled sabres and crosiers&mdash;the
glitter of gilded trappings&mdash;the curvetings of noble horses between
tents of silk and banners of gold-thread. Go out into
the country from which these splendid freemen come.</p>

<p>Here is indeed a revelation! Here is a body of men whom
history has forgotten. Strangely indeed&mdash;for it is a body far
larger than that assembled upon the plains of Volo. <em>There</em>
were, perhaps, a hundred thousand; <em>here</em> are millions. These
millions are Christians, but they are wretchedly clad and bent
with labor. They are indeed stupid,&mdash;unkempt,&mdash;degraded,&mdash;often
knavish,&mdash;but they love their country,&mdash;toil for her,&mdash;suffer
for her.</p>

<p>To them, in times of national struggles, all the weariness,&mdash;to
them, in times of national triumphs, none of the honor.</p>

<p>These are the <em>serfs</em> of those brilliant beings prancing and
caracoling and flashing on yonder plain of Volo&mdash;to the applauding
universe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidently then, there has been a mistake here. History and
poetry have forgotten to mention a fact supremely important.</p>

<p>The <em>people</em> of Poland are, after all, <em>not</em> free&mdash;<em>not</em> equal. The
voting is not voting by the <em>people</em>. Freedom and the suffrage
are for <em>serf-owners</em>,&mdash;equality is between <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>No one can deny that in this governing class were many,
very many noble specimens of manhood&mdash;yielding ease and
life for ideas&mdash;readily.</p>

<p>Emperor Henry the Fifth of Germany had tried in vain to
overcome them by war. When the Polish ambassador came
into his presence, the Emperor pointed to his weapon, and said,
"I could not overcome your nobility with <em>these</em>;"&mdash;then pointing
to an open chest filled with gold, he said, "but I will conquer
them with <em>this</em>." The ambassador wore the chains and
jewels befitting his rank. Straitway he takes off every ornament,
and flings all into the Emperor's chest together.</p>

<p>Yet myriads of such men could not have averted ruin. Polish
history proved it day by day.</p>

<p>It was not that these nobles were especially barbarous,&mdash;it
was not that they were effeminate. <em>It was simply that they
maintained one caste above another&mdash;allowing a distinction in
civil and political rights.</em> The system gave its usual luxuriant
fruitage of curses.</p>

<p><em>First</em> in the <em>material</em> condition. Labor and trade were despised.
If, in the useful class, a genius arose, the first exercise
of his genius was to get himself out of the useful class. Labor
was left to serfs; trade was left to Jews. Cities were contemptible
in all that does a city honor. Villages were huddles.
The idea thus implanted remains. Of all countries, called
civilized, Poland seems to-day, materially, the most hopeless.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>It may be said that this results from Russian invasions;&mdash;but
it was so <em>before</em> Russian invasions. It may be said that it
results from Russian oppression,&mdash;but the great central districts
of Russia are just as much under the Czar, and they
are thriving. It may be said that Poland has been wasted by
war;&mdash;but Belgium and Holland and the Rhine Palatinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
have been far more severely wasted, yet their towns are
hives, and their country districts gardens.</p>

<p>Next, as to the <em>Political</em> condition.</p>

<p>A man-mastering caste necessarily develops the individual
will morbidly and intensely. The most immediate of political
consequences is, of course, a clash between the individual will
and the general will.</p>

<p>Trouble then breaks forth in different forms in different
countries. In Spain we saw it take shape in <em>Secession</em>;&mdash;in
Italy we saw it lead to fearful territorial <em>Disunion</em>;&mdash;in Poland
it first took the form of <em>Nullification</em>.</p>

<p>The nullifying spirit naturally crystallized into an institution.
That institution was the <em>Liberum Veto</em>.</p>

<p>By this, in any national assemblage&mdash;no matter how great,
no matter how important,&mdash;the veto of a single noble could
stop all proceedings. Every special interest of every petty district
or man had power of life and death over the general interest.
The whim, or crotchet, or spite of a single man could and
did nullify measures vital to the whole nation. In 1652, Sizinski,
a noble sitting in the national diet, when great measures
were supposed to be unanimously determined upon, left his seat,
signifying his dissent. The whole vast machinery was stopped,
and Poland made miserable.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Closely allied to this was another political consequence.</p>

<p>Constant, healthful watchfulness over rights is necessary in
any republic; but there is a watchfulness which is not healthful;
it is the morbid watchfulness&mdash;the jealousy which arises
in the minds of a superior caste, <em>living generally in contact
with inferiors, and only occasionally in contact with equals</em>.</p>

<p>The Polish citizen lived on his estate. About him were inferiors,&mdash;beings
who were not citizens&mdash;depending on him&mdash;doing
him homage. But when the same citizen entered that Assembly
on the Plains of Volo all this was changed. There he met
his equals. Pride then clashed with pride,&mdash;faction rose against
faction.</p>

<p>The result I will not state in my own words, for fear it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
be thought I warp facts to make a historical parallel. I shall
translate word for word from Salvandy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>Confederations</em> were now formed&mdash;armed leagues of a
number of nobles who chose for themselves a Marshal or President,
and opposed decrees to decrees, force to force; contending
diets which raised leader against leader, and had the King
sometimes as chief, sometimes as captive; an institution deplorable
and insensate, which opened to all discontented men a
legal way to set their country on fire."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From the political causes I have named logically flowed
another.</p>

<p>In that perpetual anarchy, some factions must be beaten.
But a class with traditions and habits of oppression is very different,
when beaten, from a society swayed by manufacturing,
commercial, and legal interests. These last try to make some
arrangement. They yield, and fit matters to the new conditions.
They are anxious to get back to their work again. But
a class with habits of domineering has its own peculiar pride
to deal with. It has leisure to brood over defeat, to whine over
lost advantages, to fret over lost consideration, and you generally
find it soon plotting more insidiously than before.</p>

<p>So it was with Poland. The beaten factions did what fighting
aristocracies always do when fearful of defeat, or embittered
by it,&mdash;the vilest thing they can do, and the most dangerous&mdash;<em>they
intrigued for foreign intervention</em>.</p>

<p>Of all things, this is most fatal to nationality. Going openly
over to the enemy is bad; but intrigues with foreign powers,
hostile by interest and tradition, are unutterably vile.</p>

<p>Yet there is not a nation where a class pursuing separate and
distinct rights is tolerated, where such intrigues have not been
frequent. More than this, such intrigues have generally been
timed with diabolic sagacity.</p>

<p>The time chosen is generally some national emergency&mdash;when
the nation is writhing in domestic misfortunes, or battling
desperately against foreign foes. The Spanish nobles
chose their time for intriguing with the Moors for their intervention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
when the Spanish nation were in the most desperate
struggle&mdash;not merely for temporal power, but even for the existence
of their religion.</p>

<p>In France, the nobles chose such periods as those when
Richelieu was leading the nation against all Europe and a
large part of France. In Poland, the nobles chose the times
when the nation was struggling against absolute annihilation.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>History, to one not blinded by Polish bravery, is clear here.
The real authors of the partition of Poland were not Frederick
of Prussia, and Maria Theresa of Austria, and Catherine of
Prussia, but those proud nobles who drew surrounding nations
to intervene in Polish politics.</p>

<p>The <em>Social</em> condition was also affected naturally. Poland
went into the inevitable narcotic phase. Her court during the
reigns of its later Kings was a brothel, and her nobles its worthy
tenants.</p>

<p>What followed was natural. When the light of the last century
streamed in upon this corrupt mass, Zamoiski and men
like him tried to purify it,&mdash;to enfranchise the subordinate
caste,&mdash;to work reforms. The Polish Republic refused. Then
Providence began a work radical and terrible.</p>

<p>It is sad to see those brave citizen-nobles crushed beneath
brute force of Russians, and Austrians, and Prussians. But it
was well. One Alexander the First <em>would have</em> done, one
Alexander the Second <em>has</em> done more good for Poland than
ages of citizen serf-masters flourishing on the Plains of Volo.</p>

<p>The next nation to which I direct you is <span class="smcap">France</span>.</p>

<p>Of all modern aristocracies, hers has probably been the most
hated.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Guizot, in some respects its apologist, confesses this.
Eugenie de Guerin&mdash;the most angelic soul revealed to this age&mdash;herself
of noble descent&mdash;declares that the sight even of a
ruined chateau made her shudder<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But all that history, rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
as it is in illustrations of the noxious qualities of an oppressive
aristocracy, I will pass, save as it presents the <em>dealing of statesmen
with it</em>, their attempts to thwart it and crush it.</p>

<p>A succession of monarchs and statesmen kept up these attempts
during centuries. Philip Augustus, Louis VI. and
Louis VII., Suger, St. Louis, Philip the Long, all wrought well
at this.</p>

<p>The great thing to notice in that mediaeval French statesmanship
is that <em>they attacked the domineering caste in the right
way</em>. Every victory over it was followed not merely by setting
serfs free, but by giving them civil rights, and, to some extent,
political rights. When one of the Kings I have named gave a
Charter of Community, he did not merely make the serf a
nominal freedman; he also gave him rights, and thus wrought
him into a bulwark between the central power and the rage of
the former master.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>So far all was good. The great difficulty was that none of
those monarchs or statesmen obtained physical power enough
to enforce this policy throughout France. It was mainly confined
to towns.</p>

<p>But in the middle of the Fifteenth Century came the most
persistent man of all&mdash;Louis the Eleventh. He gained power
throughout the kingdom. If a noble became turbulent, he
hunted him; if this failed, he entrapped him. Cages, dungeons,
racks, gibbets, he used in extinguishing this sort of political
vermin; and he used them freely and beneficially.</p>

<p>His policy seems cruel. Our weak women of both sexes,
with whom the tears of a murderer's mistress outweigh the
sufferings of a crime-ridden community, will think so. It was
really merciful. Louis was, probably, a scoundrel; but he was
not a fool, and he saw that the greatest cruelty he could commit
would be to make concessions and try to <em>win over</em> the
nobility. His hard, sharp sense showed him&mdash;what all history
shows&mdash;that an oppressive caste can be crushed, but that
wheedled and persuaded it cannot be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>But Louis forgot one thing, and that the most important.
Merely to <em>defeat</em> an aristocracy was not enough. <em>He forgot to
provide guarantees for the lower classes</em>&mdash;he forgot to put rights
into their hands which should enable them forever to check and
balance the upper class when his hand was removed. You see
that this mistake is just the reverse of that committed by previous
statesmen.</p>

<p>Of course then, after the death of Louis, France relapsed
into her old anarchy. Occasionally a strong King or city put a
curb upon the nobles; but, in the main, it was the old bad history
with variations ever more and more painful.</p>

<p>Over a hundred years more of this sort went by, and the
rule of the nobles became utterly unbearable. The death of
Henry the Fourth, in 1610, left on the throne a weak child as
King, and behind the throne a weak woman as Regent. The
nobles wrought out their will completely. They seized fortifications,
plundered towns, emptied the treasury, domineered
over the monarch, and impoverished the people. Curiously
enough, too, to one who has not seen the same fact over and
over in history, the nobles, during all these outrages of theirs,
were declaiming, and groaning, and whining over their grievances
and want of rights.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Compromise after compromise was made, and to no purpose.
No sooner were compromises made than they were broken.
Finally, a great statesman, recognizing the futility of compromises,
gave the aristocracy battle. This statesman was
Richelieu.</p>

<p>The nobles tried all their modes of working I have shown in
other countries. They tried nullification, secession, disunion.
They intrigued for the intervention of Spain. They preferred
caste to country, and attempted to desert France at the moment
of her sorest need&mdash;at the siege of La Rochelle.</p>

<p>But Richelieu was too strong for them. His victories were
magnificent. While he lived France had peace.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet he makes the same mistake which Louis XI. had made.
He defeats the upper caste; but he guarantees no rights to the
lower caste; therefore he gives France no barrier against that
old flood of evils&mdash;save his own hand, and when death removes
that, chaos comes again.</p>

<p>Mazarin now grapples with them. They give him a fearful
trial. They throw France into civil war. They pretend zeal
for liberty, and form an anarchic alliance with the poor old
stupid Parliament of Paris. They make Mazarin miserable.
They throw filth upon him, then light him up with their fireworks
of wit, and set the world laughing at him. Then they
drive him out of France; but he is keen and strong, and
finally throws his nets over them, and France has another
breathing time.</p>

<p>But the nobility if quiet are not a whit more beneficial&mdash;they
are virulent and cynical as ever. Mazarin commits the same
fault which Louis XI. and Richelieu had committed before
him.</p>

<p>His mind was keen always, bold sometimes&mdash;yet never keen
enough to see, or bold enough to try the policy of giving France
a guarantee of perpetual peace, by raising up that lower class,
and giving them rights, civil and political, which should attach
them to the legitimate government, and make them a balancing
body against the aristocracy.</p>

<p>It is wonderful! Great men, fighting single-handed against
thousands, clear in foresight and insight, quick in planning,
vigorous in executing, finding every path to advantage, hurling
every weighty missile, seeing everything, daring everything,
except that one simple, broad principle in statesmanship which
could have saved France from anarchy then and from revolution
afterwards.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, it is a great lesson and a plain one. Diplomacy
based on knowledge of the ordinary motives of ordinary men
is strong,&mdash;statesmanship based on close study of the interests
and aims of states and classes is strong;&mdash;but there is a Diplomacy
and a Statesmanship infinitely stronger. Infinitely
stronger are the Diplomacy and Statemanship whose master is
a <em>heart</em>,&mdash;a heart with an instinct for truth and right;&mdash;a heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
with a faith that on truth and right alone can peace be fitly
builded.</p>

<p>Your common-place Cavour, with his deep instinct for Italian
Liberty and Unity;&mdash;your uncouth Lincoln, with his deep instinct
for American Liberty and Unity, are worth legions of
compromise builders and conciliation mongers.</p>

<p>Mazarin delivered France into the hands of Louis XIV., and
Louis brought them permanently into the narcotic phase. He
stupefied them with sensuality,&mdash;attached them to his court,&mdash;made
his palace the centre of their ambition,&mdash;gave scope to
their fancy, by setting them at powdering and painting and
frizzing,&mdash;gave scope to their activity by keeping them at gambling
and debauchery,&mdash;weaned them from turbulence by stimulating
them to decorate their bodies and to debase their
souls.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The central power was thus saved;&mdash;the people went on suffering
as before.</p>

<p>Under the Regency of Louis XV. the nobility went from
bad to worse. Their scorn for labor made them despise not
merely those who toiled in Agriculture and Manufactures&mdash;it
led them logically to openly neglect, and secretly despise professions
generally thought the most honorable. When Racine
ridiculed lawyers,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and when Moliere ridiculed physicians<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and
scholars,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> they but yielded to this current.</p>

<p>Wise men saw the danger. Laws were passed declaring that
commerce should not be derogatory to nobility. Abbé Coyer
wrote a book to entice nobles into commerce. It had a captivating
frontispiece, representing a nobleman elegantly dressed
going on board a handsome merchant ship.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> All in vain. The
serf-mastering traditions were too strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The Revolution comes. The nobles stand out against the
entreaties of Louis XVI.&mdash;the statesmanship of Turgot, the
financial skill of Necker,&mdash;the keenness of Sieyes,&mdash;the boldness
of Mirabeau. The very existence of France is threatened;
but they have erected, as nobles always do, their substitute for
patriotism. They stand by their order. Royalty yields to the
third estate,&mdash;the clergy yield, the nobility will not.</p>

<p>They are at last scared into momentary submission to right
and justice and the spirit of the age. On the memorable
Fourth of August they renounce their most hideous oppressions.</p>

<p>There is no end of patriotic speeches by these converts to
liberty. The burden of all is the same. They are anxious to
give up their oppressions. It is of no use to struggle longer,
they are beaten, they will yield to save France.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Artists illustrate
the great event, some pathetically, some comically.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The
millennium seems arrived, a <em>Te Deum</em> is appointed. Yet plain
common sense Buchez notes one thing in all this not so pleasant.
In these "transports and outpourings," (<em>transports et
l'effusion de sentiments genereux</em>,) one very important thing
has been forgotten. <em>The nobles forget to give, and the people
forget to take&mdash;guarantees.</em><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Woe to the people who trust merely the word of an upper
caste habituated to oppression! Woe to the statesmen who
do not at once crystallize such promises into constitutional
and legislative acts!</p>

<p>These nobles shortly regretted their concessions and sought
to evade them.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The aristocrats whom they represented soon
denied the right of their deputies to make these concessions,
and soon after repudiated them.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>How could it be otherwise? When you speak of concessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
by a caste habituated to oppression, you do not mean that they
give away a single, simple, tangible thing, and that <em>that</em> is the
end of it;&mdash;not at all. You mean that they give up old habits
of thought,&mdash;habits of action. You mean that every day of
their lives thereafter they are to give up a habit, or a fancy, or
a comfort. No mere promises of theirs to do this can be
trusted. There must be guarantees fixed immutably, bedded
into the constitution,&mdash;clamped into the laws. That same anchoring
of liberties, and not "<em>transports et l'effusion de sentiments
genereux</em>," is statesmanship.</p>

<p>These concessions were not thus secured. The old habits of
oppression again got the upper hand. The upper class became
as hostile to liberty and peace as ever.</p>

<p>Then thundered through France the Revolution. It <em>must</em>
come;&mdash;that great and good French Revolution which did
more to advance mankind in ten years than had been done
politically in ten centuries,&mdash;which cost fewer lives to establish
great principles than the Grand Monarque had flung away to
gratify his whimsies! The right hand of the Almighty was
behind it.</p>

<p>I refuse at the will of English Tory historians to lament
more over the sufferings that besotted caste of oppressors
brought upon themselves during those three years, than over
the sufferings they brought upon the people during three times
three centuries.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The great thing was now partially done which Louis XI. and
Richelieu had left entirely undone. The lower class were not
merely freed from serfdom; they received guarantees of full
civil rights.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>So far all was well, but at another point the constituent assembly
stumbled. They were not bold enough to give full
<em>political</em> rights. They thought the peasantry too ignorant&mdash;too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
much debased by a long servitude, to be entrusted with
political rights,&mdash;therefore they denied them, and invented for
them "passive citizenship."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>It was skillfully devised, but none the less fatal. The denial
of political rights to the enfranchised was one of the two
great causes of the destruction of the Constitution of 1791, and
of the inauguration of the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p>Political rights could not be refused long. As they could
not be obtained in peace the freed peasantry never allowed
France rest until it gained them by long years of bloodshed and
anarchy. Revolution after revolution has failed of full results.
Dynasty after dynasty has failed to give quiet until a great
statesman in our own time, Napoleon III., has been bold
enough to make suffrage universal.</p>

<p>Whatever the first French Revolution failed to do, it failed
to do mainly by lack of bold faith in giving <em>political</em> rights;&mdash;whatever
it succeeded in doing, it succeeded by giving full <em>civil</em>
rights.</p>

<p>When Louis XVIII. was brought back by foreign bayonets,
the nobility also came back jubilant; all seemed about to give
France over to her old caste of oppressors. The revolution
was gone, its great theories were gone, its great men were swept
away by death and by discouragement worse than death.</p>

<p>But one barrier stood between France and all her old misery.
That barrier stood firm; it was the enfranchised peasantry&mdash;possessing
civil rights and confiscated property in land.
Against these the whole might of the nobility beat in vain.</p>

<p>Peace came, and with peace prosperity. France had been
fearfully shattered by ages of evil administration and false political
economy; she had been devastated by wars without and
within; she had been plundered of an immense indemnity by
the allies; the best of her people had been swept off by conscriptions;
but under the distribution of lands to the former
serfs, and the full guarantee of civil rights and the germs of
political rights, the nation showed an energy in recuperation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and a breadth of prosperity never before known in all her
history.</p>

<p>There are other nations which, did time allow, might be
summoned before us to aid our insight into the tendencies of
castes habituated to oppression.</p>

<p>I might show from the annals of Germany how such a caste,
having dragged the country through a thousand years of anarchy,
have left it in chronic disunion,&mdash;the loss of all natural
consideration, and oft-recurring civil wars, one of which is now
devastating her.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>I might show from the history of Russia how the despotism
of the Autocrat has been made necessary to save the empire
from a worse foe&mdash;from a serf-mastering aristocracy. And I
might go further and show how the statesmanship which has
emancipated the lower class in Russia has recognized the great
truth that the nation is not safe against the aristocracy&mdash;that
no barrier can stand against them except the enfranchised endowed
with rights and lands.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>But I am aware that an objection to this estimate of the
noxious activity of an Aristocracy may be raised from the history
of England.</p>

<p>It may be said that there the course of the nobles has been
different&mdash;that some of the hardest battles against tyrants
have been won by combination of nobles, that they have laid
the foundations of free institutions, that, under monarchs who
have hated national liberty, nobles have been among the foremost
martyrs.</p>

<p>Let us look candidly at this.</p>

<p>It is true that the Earl of Pembroke and the Barons of England
led the struggle for Magna Charta; it is true that the
Earl of Leicester and his associate barons summoned the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
really representative Parliament;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> it is true that Surrey and
Raleigh and Russell suffered martyrdom at the hands of
tyrants.</p>

<p>It is true, moreover, that English nobles have not generally
been so turbulent in what I have called the Vitriolic period, nor
so debased in the Narcotic period, as most other European Aristocracies.
They were, indeed, very violent in the wars of the
Roses,&mdash;many of them were very debased under Charles the
Second, and again under the first and last Georges, and it is
quite likely will be again under that very unpromising
ruler, Albert Edward, who seems developing the head of
George the Third and the heart of George the Fourth<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>&mdash;but
they have never been quite so violent or debased as the Continental
nobles at similar periods.</p>

<p>But all this, so far from weakening the thesis I support,
strengthens it&mdash;nay, clenches it.</p>

<p>For the nobility of England, less than any other in Europe,
was based upon the oppression of a subject class. From the
earliest period when law begins to be established in England
we find that the serf system begins to be extinguished. The
courts of law quietly adopted and steadily maintained the
principle that in any question between lord and serf the presumption
was in favor of the inferior's right to liberty rather
than the superior's right to property.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The whole current set
that way, and we find growing in England that middle class,
steady and sturdy by the possession of rights, which won Agincourt
and Crecy and Marston Moor and Worcester,&mdash;which
made her country a garden and her cities marts for the world.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>It is because England had so little of a serf-ruling caste in
her history that she has been saved from so many of the calamities
which have befallen other nations.</p>

<p>And there is another great difference between England and
other nations, a difference of tremendous import. She has not
stopped after making her lower classes nominally free. She
has given them full civil rights and a constantly increasing
share of political rights. Thus she has made them guardians
of freedom. This is the great reason why her nobility have
not destroyed her. This enfranchised class has been a barrier
against aristocratic encroachment.</p>

<p>And yet in so far as the upper caste of England have partaken
of traditions and habits of oppression they have deeply injured
their country. Not a single great modern measure which
they have not bitterly opposed.</p>

<p>The Repeal of the Corn Laws, the Abolition of Tests, the
Reform Bill, the improvement of the Universities&mdash;these and
a score more of great measures nearly as important, they have
fought to the last.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>To them is mainly due that grasping of lands which has
brought so much misery on the working class.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>To them is due that cold-blooded dealing with Lafayette and
Bailly and other patriots of the French Revolution, which
finally resulted in the Brunswick Manifesto and the Reign of
Terror.</p>

<p>To them and their followers is due that most stupid crime
which any nation ever committed in its foreign policy&mdash;the bitter,
cowardly injustice toward our own Republic in its recent
struggle.</p>

<p>This is what the <em>remnant</em> of caste-spirit in England has accomplished,
and it is only because it has not been habituated
to oppression by serf-owning, and because it was held in check
by a lower class possessing civil and political rights, that it was
not frightful in turbulence and debauchery.</p>

<p>So stands modern history as it bears upon the thesis I have
proposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>It shows a man-mastering caste, even when its man-mastering
has passed from a fact into a tradition, to be the most frequent
foe and the most determined with which nations have to
grapple. By its erection of a substitute for patriotism, it is of
all foes the most intractable; by its erection of a substitute for
political morality, the most deceptive; by its proneness to disunion
and disintegration, the most bewildering; by its habit of
calling for the intervention of foreign powers, the most disheartening;
by its morbid sensitiveness over pretended rights,
the most watchful; in its unscrupulousness, the most determined;
by its brilliancy, the most powerful in cheating the
world into sympathy.</p>

<p>But history gives more than this. To the thesis I have advanced
it gives, as you have seen, a corollary. Having shown
what foe to right and liberty is most vigorous and noxious, it
shows how alone that foe can be conquered and permanently
dethroned. The lesson of failures and successes in the world's
history points to one course, and to that alone.</p>

<p>Here conquest cannot do it; spasmodic severity cannot do
it; wheedling of material interests, orating up patriotic interests,
cannot do it. History shows just one course. <em>First, the
oppressive caste must be put down at no matter what outlay of
blood and treasure; next, it must be kept dethroned by erecting
a living, growing barrier against its return to power, and
the only way of erecting that barrier is by guaranteeing civil
rights in full, and political rights at least in germ, to the subject
class.</em></p>

<p>Herein is written the greatness or littleness of nations&mdash;herein
is written the failure or success of their great struggles.
In all history, those be the great nations which have boldly
grappled with political dragons, and not only put them down
but <em>kept</em> them down.</p>

<p>The work of saving a nation from an oligarchy then is two
fold. It is not finished until both parts are completed. Nations
forget this at their peril. Nearly every great modern
revolution wherein has been gain to liberty has had to be
fought over a second time. So it was with the English Revolution
of 1642. So it was with the French Revolutions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
1789 and 1830. What has been gained by bravery has been
lost by treachery. Nations have forgotten that vigorous fighting
to gain liberty must be followed by sound planning to
secure it.</p>

<p>What is this sound planning? Is it superiority in duplicity?
Not at all; it is the only planning which insists on frank dealing.
Is it based on cupidity? Not at all; it is based on
Right. Is it centered in Revenge? Not at all; its centre
is Mercy and its circumference is Justice. It may say to the
discomfited oppressor, you shall have Mercy; but it must say
to the enfranchised, you shall have Justice.</p>

<p>Acknowledging this, Suger and the great mediaeval statesmen
succeeded; ignoring this, Louis. XI., Richelieu, and a host
of great modern statesmen failed.</p>

<p>To keep the haughty and turbulent caste of oppressors in
their proper relations, the central authority in every nation has
been obliged to form a close alliance with the down-trodden
caste of workers. If these have been ignorant it has had to
instruct them; if they have been wretched, it has had to raise
them; and the simple way&mdash;nay, the only way to instruct and
raise them has been to give them rights, civil and political,
which will force them to raise and instruct themselves.</p>

<p>But it may be said that some subject classes are <em>too low</em> thus
to be lifted&mdash;that there are some races too weak to be thus
wrought into a barrier against aristocracy. I deny it. For
history denies it. The race is not yet discovered in which the
average man is not better and safer with rights than without
them.</p>

<p>Think you that <em>your</em> ancestors were so much better than
<em>other</em> subject classes? Look into any town directory. The
names show an overwhelming majority of us descendants of
European serfs and peasantry. I defy you to find any body of
men more degraded and stupid than our ancestors.</p>

<p>Do you boast Anglo-Saxon ancestry?&mdash;look at Charles
Kingsley's picture in Hereward of the great banquet, the
apotheosis of wolfishness and piggishness; or look at Walter
Scott's delineation in Ivanhoe of Gurth the swine-herd,
dressed in skins, the brass collar soldered about his neck like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the collar of a dog, and upon it the inscription, "Gurth the
born thrall of Cedric."</p>

<p>Do you boast French ancestry?&mdash;look into Orderic Vital, or
Froissart, or De Comines, and see what manner of man was
your ancestor, "<em>Jacques Bonhomme</em>"&mdash;kicked, cuffed, plundered,
murdered, robbed of the honor of his wife and the custody
of his children, not allowed to wear good clothing,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> not
recognized as a man and a brother,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> not indeed in early times
recognized as a man at all.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Do you boast German ancestry?&mdash;look at Luther's letters and
see how the unutterable stupidity of your ancestors vexed him.</p>

<p>Yet from these progenitors of yours, kept besotted and degraded
through centuries by oppression, have, by comparatively
a few years of freedom, been developed the barriers which have
saved modern states.</p>

<p>Is it said that this bestowal of rights on the oppressed is dangerous?
History is full of proofs that the faith in Heaven's
justice which has led statesmen to solve great difficulties by
<em>bestowing</em> rights has proved far more safe than the attempt to
evade great difficulties by <em>withholding</em> rights.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Is it said that the anarchic tendencies of an oppressive caste
can be overcome by compromise and barter? History shows
that the chances in trickery and barter are immensely in their
favor.</p>

<p>Is it said that the era of such dangers is past&mdash;that <em>civilization</em>
will modify the nature of oppressive castes? That is the
most dangerous delusion of all. In all annals, a class, whether
rough citizens as in Poland, or smooth gentlemen as in France,
based on traditions or habits of oppression, has proved a <em>reptile</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<em>caste</em>. Its coat may be mottled with romance, and smooth
with sophistry, and glossy with civilization;&mdash;it may wind itself
gracefully in chivalric courses; but its fangs will be found none
the less venomous, its attacks none the less cruel, its skill in
prolonging its reptile life, even after seeming death wounds,
none the less deceitful.</p>

<p>Is it said that to grapple with such a reptile caste is dangerous?
History shows not one example where the plain, hardy
people have boldly faced it and throttled it and not conquered
it.</p>

<p>The course is plain, and there it but one. Strike until the
reptile caste spirit is scotched; then pile upon it a new fabric of
civil and political rights until its whole organism of evil is
crushed forever.</p>

<p>For this policy alone speaks the whole history of man,&mdash;to
this policy alone stand pledged all the attributes of God.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
